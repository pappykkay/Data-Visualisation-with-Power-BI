 An Overview Of Electricity Production In Western And Eastern Europe: A Comparative Analysis

The objective of the Visualisation was to compare electricity production statistics for selected countries in Western and Eastern Europe. The study focused on available energy sources. It is imperative to note that there exist other sources of energy not considered due to the non-availability of data. These sources include electricity production from biogases, tidal, wave, and ocean electricity, peat, geothermal and municipal waste to mention a few. 

The approach made use of the Microsoft Power BI platformvisualisation taking advantage of its user-friendly interface, formula expression, and appealing user interface. 
The DAX statement was helpful to summarise each country’s data summation which helped in analysis.

The look and feel of the charts were adjusted to reflect a blend of colours that protects viewers’ eyesight. It is very important to be sensitive to the audience whose health could be affected by the report. For this reason, high colour contrast was avoided in the visual rendition of this report.  

Using the charts to visualize data, definite trends were easily highlighted. For instance, using a clustered bar chart, it was very easy to see that Russian Federation does not have a solar program for electricity generation. Russia Federation is the least diversified in terms of electricity production sources. The in-built tooltip format tool provided valuable addition in highlighting items of interest. So also, is the drill-down option.

Russia Federation had the highest total electricity production and accounted for roughly 30% of Total Production across all West and East Europe. Russia Federation had the largest thermal production output well above all other countries in Europe.

The bulk of electricity production in Europe comes from thermal sources thereby heating up the climate most notably in Russia and Germany.
The effect of Covid-19 pandemic was visible in electricity production across all the European countries as 2019 recorded the lowest output over the decade.

There is a noticeable higher growth in renewable electricity sources in Western Europe compared with the Eastern Europe. However, there is a slight reduction in non-renewable sources. Renewable electricity sources accounted for only 20% of total production output across Europe.

France witnessed the fastest growth in Solar electricity production while Russia has the fastest increase in nuclear electricity sources. Czech Republic has the fastest growth and possible investment in Wind electricity production.

For the target for climate change to be met, more work needs to be done in eastern Europe than in the south and a considerable decrease needs to be seen in non-renewable electricity production sources across Europe to help preserve our climate.
